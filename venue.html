        <h1>Department of Anthropology</h1>
        <p>
            Since 1979 the discipline of Anthropology and its courses were taught in the School of Social
            Sciences. It became an independent department in 1988. Over the years the department has earned
            a reputation in the country for its faculty publications, extra mural research grants and academic
            outreach. The department’s students have been regularly qualifying the National Eligibility Test
            (NET) and are awarded research fellowships by UGC, ICMR, ICSSR and other academic bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The achievements of the Department have been recognised by the UGC and it awarded the Special
            Assistance Programme (SAP) for the first time during the year 2011-12. Subsequently, the UGC-DRS
            (Departmental Research Support) Phase II was awarded to the Department. Under the Institution
            of Eminence (IoE), Ministry of MHRD, the Department has conducted several research projects,
            academic programs, writing workshops and facilitated research scholars to visit and participate in
            academic programmes abroad (Europe, Japan, USA, UK).
        </p>
        <p>
            The Department imparts training in theoretical and applied research in Social Anthropology, which
            equips students to meet the academic challenges in urban, rural, and tribal field studies. Besides
            studying social and cultural diversity, the Department trains students to apply anthropological
            knowledge to the understanding of contemporary social problems and development issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Practical training is imparted in Social Anthropology, Physical and Archaeological Anthropology
            courses. The department has developed a museum as a teaching aid. The museum houses
            archaeological artefacts and cultural materials for research and learning. The research projects
            conducted by Faculty provide avenues for students to gain a hands-on experience in research and
            learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            By facilitating internship opportunities under the NEP structure, students receive practical learning
            in various Community Based Organizations, research organizations and industrial houses.
